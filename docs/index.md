## Arriving for the first time

When you join Craftia, you will start in the space ship and your personal spawn (not world spawn) will be set to the space ship. Get your go kit with the following command:

    /kits go

The go kit contains Elytra, a compass and a Lode stone.

## Exploring the planet surface

Wear the Elytra on your body so you can glide down to the surface and explore. At any time you can warp back to the space ship with the command:

    /warp ship

If you find a place of interest that you want to return to, place the Lode stone and right-click with your compass. After warping back to the space ship (or going elsewhere on the map), you can now find your way back to this point.

## Establishing a base
